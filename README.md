# Heart-Disease-Classification
Heart disease classification in machine learning involves the application of advanced algorithms to identify and categorize different cardiac conditions based on patient data. Leveraging vast datasets that include information such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), medical history, and diagnostic test results, machine learning models can distinguish between various heart diseases with high accuracy.

These models play a pivotal role in early detection and risk assessment, enabling healthcare professionals to intervene proactively and tailor treatment plans for individual patients. Common classification tasks include distinguishing between types of arrhythmias, identifying coronary artery disease, and predicting the likelihood of heart failure. Features like deep learning and ensemble methods enhance the model's ability to analyze complex patterns and subtle variations in the data, contributing to more precise and reliable outcomes.
